	I'm usually shy but also chatty. I'm a sensitive and honest person. I don't like being angry and worried, but sometimes I feel like this. I like being natural like I am and I don't like the people who are hypocrite. I like going shopping and  dancing.

	Dancing is my true hobby, because when I dance my life is different, and I feel well and free. My friends are important in my life, because they help me in difficult moments, and are always there when I need them. But, my family is also important for me because they always want the best for me.

	I'm interested in travelling and knowing different countries and places, because I want to know things of other people and other cultures. I'm also interested in music and singers. The cinema is also interesting for me.
What I'm really afraid of is love, because when I fall in love, I hardly talk to him, and it's a very embarrassing situation, because I'm very shy. But nevertheless I like love.
