I was born in Barcelona on the 22nd of February 1995. When I was young, we lived in a different house and when my sister was born in 1999 we moved to a bigger house, but we continued living in the same neighborhood.

My earliest memory is very clear. All the summers we used to go to my village in my grandparent’s house, and now I have a lot of friends that I met when I was little. Sometimes we remember the things that we did and we laugh a lot! I also remember my first day in Solc school, I remember that I was one of the few children that didn’t cry, because when I was younger I liked so much going to school but now is different because I go to school to study and do a lot of homework and in the past I used to go to school to play with my friends!

I’ve been in the same school and I’m in ESO. My friends have been the same but of course I’ve met new friends! I’ve changed since I was young. I think that I’m shyer with new people but the thing that hasn’t changed is my personality: I’m very cheerful!

When I finish secondary school, I’ll probably study higher secondary school on history and then I’ll probably go to university and I’ll study teaching or journalism. I’d like to study in Germany and meet new people, but I think that I will never forget the people that have been my friends in this school, because they’ve proved me that they’ve become my family!
