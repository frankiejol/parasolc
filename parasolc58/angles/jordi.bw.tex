\subsection*{My school}

My school is not very big but I like it.

In my classroom we have many things: the teacher’s desk, a blakboard, a bookcase, desks and chairs .We also have a computer room, a music room and a gym.
The garden is very beautiful, there are a lot of trees and plants. And we can play football and basketball.
